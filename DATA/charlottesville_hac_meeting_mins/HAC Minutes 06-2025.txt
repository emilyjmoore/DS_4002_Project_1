\f0 Landlord Risk Reduction Fund (LRRF) Program/Policy Development Process\
AW: Goal is to have draft proposal and workplan sent to City Manager by July 8, with\
HAC\'92s help. Survey results will be sent to HAC by July 1. Implementation for fiscal\
year 2027.\
SM: Learned from Atlanta Housing Authority that they have similar program.\
Effective, didn\'92t cost that much, not often used. Psychological benefit, peace of mind\
for landlords is the main effect.\
If $ can come out of unallocated CAHF funds, could aim for sooner than FY2027.\
AW: CAHF money is from FY2026 after July 1.\

\cf3 PdO: City Manager designated some awardees as \'93fundamental services\'94 (thus not\
eligible for CAHF and HOPS) which left some money over.\
SM: As an example, the Financial Opportunity Center (under PHA umbrella) could\
become a \'93fundamental service\'94 for year-to-year predictability of funds.\
AW: That surplus has been allocated to BRACH for an emergency grant, as well as\
HOPS $. Any other $ would require reallocation by Council, hard to speed up\
timeline, at least a year out from implementation. RFI (Request for Info - asking orgs\
what projects they have coming online and may need funding for) mid-late August,\
CAHF and HOPS later in Fall, then NOFA (Notice of Funding Availability) for LRRF\
once approved.\
SM: Ideally LRFF discussed in early spring 2026. Will be administrative costs beyond\
the $50-75k in the fund to consider, especially if administered by outside org from\
the city.\
II.
\f1  
\f0 Land Bank Authority (LBA) Workplan\
AW: Between now and August, move to drafting operating manual and ordinance\
finalization. Workplan: Jun-Aug draft re-vetted, then legal prep and public\
engagement in early Fall. By December, workplan for City Manager, earliest date for\
Council vote Jan 2026. Goal is to align LBA timeline with Tax Abatement program\
adoption.\
SM: Question re: HAC wanting feedback on changes to its version of ordinance.\
AW: Have already drafted memo to Kellie Brown re: HAC\'92s thoughts. Will share with\
HAC, members can add comments that aren\'92t represented. Have also included\
redline edits into the present version of draft ordinance. Before public engagement,\
ordinance will return to HAC.\
SM: If City Attorney or City Manager does or doesn\'92t accept a HAC change or\
proposal, would be nice to have not just City\'92s decisions but reasoning why.\
III.
\f1  
\f0 HAC Attendance Policy and Special Provisions\
AW: Per City Attorney, will likely be ok for CRHA to send director\'92s designee, as well\
as nonprofits.\
Impromptu discussion of federal funding updates occurred.\
SM: Tax Code Reconciliation budget approved by house, currently senate debating. Each\
committee works on topic area, then submits proposals. Goal is to pass by July 4\'96unlikely.\
Mostly a catastrophe across the board. Some highlights, expansion of LIHTC program, making\
New Market tax credit program permanent. But it\'92s a massive deficit increase. Benefits very high\
income earners, low income workers will see cost increases and benefits decrease.\
Rescission Bill process (pulling back dollars that have already been allocated) targets USAID, NPR.\
Test case that could lead to other reccissions. If passed, removes that funding. Pocket rescission\
theory\'96if President submits a rescission, funds are locked for 45 days, but what if it\'92s issued less\
than 45 days before end of fiscal year? Untested, legality unknown.\
Fiscal year 2026 budget is 10/1-9/30. Operating on multiple continuing resolutions, extension of\
last year\'92s budget that continues previous rates and is essentially a decrease. Haven\'92t passed an\
on time budget in 5+ years. Goal is 9/30 FY 26 resolution, but widely seen as not possible. Big\

\cf3 question of what will happen at that point, what will be cut and not, or passage of another\
continuing resolution.\
In President\'92s skinny budget, proposal is to cut HUD funding by half, redistribute half as block\
grants to states to use at their discretion, but states would have to fund the other half and build\
out administrative capacity. Basically pushing funding burden onto states instead of fed, not a\
real cut overall.\
