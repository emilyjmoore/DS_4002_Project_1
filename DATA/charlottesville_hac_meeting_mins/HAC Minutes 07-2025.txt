\f1\i\b0 Approval of each deferred to next HAC meeting\

\f0\i0\b Introduction from Kellie Brown, Director of Neighborhood Development Services\
KB:
\f2\b0  First visit to a HAC meeting; introduces herself as Director of Neighborhood\
Development Services (NDS). NDS happy to take on some staff members from Office of\
Community Solutions (OSC) since it\'92s been dissolved and reorganized, including\
Antoine Williams and Madelyn Metzler. Antoine is currently out on leave.\

\f2\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf2 b. 
\f0\b Phil d\'92Oronzio (PdO):
\f2\b0  Asks about the new zoning ordinance and the court decision\
voiding the ordinance\

\f0\b KB:
\f2\b0  No update to provide beyond the press release City recently sent out.\

\f0\b JJ:
\f2\b0  Notes this is her first time meeting KB.\

\f0\b Dan Rosensweig (DR):
\f2\b0  Asks about the poll sent out to HAC members asking about\
preferences re: pausing meetings until October to allow for the transition of OSC staff to\
NDS, and to allow NDS to address the court\'92s decision re: zoning ordinance.\

\f0\b Madelyn Metzler (MM):
\f2\b0  Vote was 6-3 in favor of pausing.\

\f0\b Joy Johnson (JJ):
\f2\b0  Voted not to pause. Are there other items to look at in the workplan?\
Want to make sure we\'92re sticking to workplan we established.\

\f0\b PdO: 
\f2\b0 Can we get a briefing from Madelyn about staff capacity and responsibilities?\

\f0\b JJ:
\f2\b0  Want to meet with MM like I did monthly with Antoine. Suspicious about committees\
not meeting, and a lot happening in the meantime.\

\f0\b Nicole Scro (NS):
\f2\b0  Makes a point of commending OCS staff (Antoine Williams, Alan\
Peura, Madelyn Metzler) for their work during this time.\

\f0\b PdO: 
\f2\b0 Motion to skip August meeting, and Chair and Vice Chair can decide whether to\
meet in September.\

\f1\i Motion passes 6-0.\

\f0\i0\b Dan Rosensweig (DR):
\f2\b0  During COVID, analysis of affordable housing deficit. HAC was\
working on a blueprint for closing the gap and measuring how we\'92re doing. Units needed\
per income level rentals and housing, reasonable assumptions of how many could be\
constructed. Re: tax abatement program, will facilitate certain kinds of units, but not\
others. Would like to look at the IAT again (Intervention Analysis Tool). Rory Stolzenberg\
(Planning Commission member) and Sunshine Mathon were working on that.\

\f0\b KB:
\f2\b0  Introduces Ose Akinlotan and Tori Kanellopoulos from NDS\'92s Long Range Planning\
department.\

\f0\b JJ: 
\f2\b0 Asks about Land Bank Ordinance (LBO) update.\

\f0\b MM: 
\f2\b0 LBO been on back burner due to staffing absences in the newly-formed Housing\
Dept. Have shared material with the City Attorney but haven\'92t gotten feedback from the\
Attorney or City Manager\'92s office.\

\f0\b AP:
\f2\b0  Working with a graduate student, Stephen Kelly at Batten School of Public Policy,\
researching Land Bank best practices. Goal is to develop a comprehensive manual to\
use as the Land Bank is stood up.\

\f0\b KB: 
\f2\b0 With staff priority being the Zoning Ordinance\'92s repeal and reinstatement, won\'92t be\
able to return feedback to HAC until Fall most likely.\

\f0\b Update on Charlottesville Affordable Housing Tax Abatement Program\
Alan Peura (AP):
\f2\b0  Presented to the Planning Commission, CADRE (Chamber of\
Commerce\'92s Developer Roundtable group), we are getting feedback. Main new item is\

\fs19\fsmilli9960 Page 2 of 4
\f3\fs24 \cf0 \page 
\f2\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf2 contract signed with 3TP Consulting. Doing market analysis in Charlottesville,\
submarkets (types, sizes, locations). Looking at impediments to construction to\
determine if and how tax abatement could address costs of ADU requirement. Tariffs\
and threats of tariffs driving up material costs, possible labor concerns. Goal is to have a\
penultimate draft in late, then host a community meeting with HAC for further community\
feedback.\

\f0\b NS:
\f2\b0  Contracting out to 3TP to develop the program has helped proposal not be delayed\
during Zoning Ordinance legal issues?\

\f0\b AP: 
\f2\b0 Yes, it\'92s moving forward. Tax abatement is an option to consider under old or new\
zoning code, whatever happens.\

\f0\b PdO: 
\f2\b0 Before abatement is designed, we need to know what environment we are working\
in. Particularly interested in how smaller projects could be helped, and those projects\
would be very different from larger developments.\

\f0\b AP:
\f2\b0  Study\'92s market research will be necessary to inform the design of the tax\
abatement. Firm did similar projects in Charleston and Tampa, how various incentives\
affect projects\'92\'92 feasibility. Grad student Stephen Kelly doing comparative analysis of tax\
abatement programs across the country. Council, others will have a plethora of data to\
use come late fall, early spring. Having conversation with Baltimore City staff re: their\
model that is supported by local advocacy group Livable Cville. They get yearly data\
about gaps between market and affordable rents to inform how much tax abatement will\
cover.\

\f0\b NS:
\f2\b0  At CADRE and last HAC meeting, comments re: covering the affordability gap down\
to the level of voucher holders\'92 rental payments.\

\f0\b DR:
\f2\b0  First, Habitat for Humanity has signed off on letters with Livable Cville in the past\
but not this one. Agree with much of their letter, notes importance of items 7 and 8\'97tax\
abatement coming out of City\'92s $10 million Affordable Housing fund, and gearing tax\
abatement towards rental units in private market projects. Notes overinvestment\
nationally in one type of intervention at expense of others. Could be a great program for\
people just below market-rate levels. Public housing, Permanent Supportive Housing,\
and homeownership should also be part of this conversation.\

\f0\b PdO:
\f2\b0  Need to look at this program for what it is, not what it isn\'92t. If it works at 60% most\
efficiently, don\'92t try to stretch it into other areas where it won\'92t work.\

\f0\b DR:
\f2\b0  Not speaking to tactics but to larger vision.\

\f0\b NS: 
\f2\b0 Piedmont Housing Alliance has done tax abatements for most of their projects, but\
that abatement money hasn\'92t been counted in the City\'92s $10 million Affordable Housing\
Fund before. Disagree with Livable Cville\'92s point there.\

\f0\b DR:
\f2\b0  If tax abatement doesn\'92t cover the full difference between market and affordable\
rent, that leftover difference will have to come from somewhere.\

\f0\b MP:
\f2\b0  Using Affordable Housing fund money for a tax abatement would be a huge\
mistake. Incentivizing landlords to accept housing vouchers as part of this plan should\
be explored. Also shouldn\'92t assume our local housing market needs this intervention.\

\fs19\fsmilli9960 Page 3 of 4
\f3\fs24 \cf0 \page 
\f2\fs22\fsmilli11040 \cf2 Because of high land costs etc., skeptical that the City\'92s Affordable Dwelling Unit\
requirements in the Zoning Ordinance are the major barrier to new projects. Don\'92t want\
to give an abatement that isn\'92t needed. Student rental market is very different than the\
rest of the market, shouldn\'92t be treated the same.\

\f0\b DR: 
\f2\b0 Possible that City could make student housing projects ineligible for abatements.\

\f0\b MP:
\f2\b0  Verve did primarily payment in lieu to meet ADU requirement. Most people who\
need affordable housing wouldn\'92t want to live in a student housing building.\

\f0\b NS: 
\f2\b0 Verve is under the old ordinance.\

\f0\b MM: 
\f2\b0 Did use the new ordinance\'92s fee schedule for Verve\'92s payment in lieu. City didn\'92t\
dictate any inclusion of affordable units.\

\f0\b AP:
\f2\b0  Council, consultants aware of possibility that abatement program wouldn\'92t be\
indicated for Charlottesville. Example of Boston coming to that conclusion. Agreement\
that giving abatement to a project that would happen anyway would be a poor outcome.\

\f0\b NS: 
\f2\b0 At CADRE, discussion about how the types of projects remaining in the market\
have significant challenges to them. Fair to say ADU req isn\'92t the main impediment, but\
not to say that some projects wouldn\'92t be made possible by abatement. 3TP could offer\
a useful tool to use moving forward.\

\f0\b MP: 
\f2\b0 Sees new ordinance as giving away air rights for ADU req\'92s. Because AMIs are\
high in Charlottesville, fear of not reaching the lowest levels of affordability with an\
abatement. Could end up helping young professionals at 60% and not people with the\
greatest need.\

\f0\b Public Comment\

\f2\b0 a. 
\f0\b James Snyder:
\f2\b0  Wife and I own small cottage at 206 B 5th St SW. Bought in 2005, 1of 6\
on 1/3 acre (Oak Lawn cottages). Oak Grove cottages by Dan Walters across the street,\
5th St Flats behind that. Stable, moderately priced. My concern is properties were\
rezoned to CX-5. Our property is now nonconforming. New projects next to our property\
will have no setbacks once developed. Re: 7th St Student Housing Project, building\
would be 3 feet from Oak Grove cottages, very close to historic church. Very\
destabilizing. Don\'92t want CX-5 zoning to be reestablished if Zoning Ordinance is\
repealed and then later readopted. City bought houses just to south of Oak Lawn\
cottages, good investment. This portion of Fifeville will be destroyed by zoning. We\
didn\'92t know about the new zoning. This is a sensitive area. Student housing doesn\'92t\
belong here, should be in Barracks Road shopping area. Sent petition to Planning\
Commission to not reinstate CX-5 zoning.\
